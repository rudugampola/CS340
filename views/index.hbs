  (GOAT)® is a traveling agency that provides tours for travel
enthusiasts. GOAT provides tour guides in 12 different locations throughout the
globe. GOAT is looking to build a database to help keep track of logs that contain
information regarding a tour a customer goes on, as well as keep track of reviews
of customers of a particular trip. The company will be able to track customer
information and assign a guide to each customer, while customers are asked to
review the tour at the end of their tours.
